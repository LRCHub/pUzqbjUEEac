[00:10.48] (ATL Jacob, ATL Jacob)
[00:21.48] 
[00:13.23] (Yeah) uh, uh, woke up in that mode again
[00:16.58] (Yeah) uh, uh, please don't call my phone again
[00:19.65] (Yeah) uh, uh, walk in causin' havoc
[00:23.13] Yes, that is a habit
[00:24.67] Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah
[00:39.67] 
[00:26.17] They watch me on the stages (stages), they watch me go crazy (crazy)
[00:29.65] I'm 'bout to make 'em pick the pieces up, then lock 'em in the cages (cages)
[00:32.96] A lot can happen in a couple minutes, lots of reasons, lots of things in action
[00:36.26] Lots of people watchin' things unravel, watch the moment, watch me goin'
[01:12.26] 
[00:39.55] Locked and loaded, say some shit that'll make 'em think it, thought-provoking
[00:42.66] Only do things that are makin' history, tryna make moves that'll make 'em miss me
[00:45.82] Stay as busy as I want to, takin' trips to escape a bit
[00:49.29] Make it shift to a different gear, takin' things to a different tier
[01:23.29] 
[00:52.53] Pop up with it on the roof, like a proper villain
[00:55.45] All this spendin' got me in a mood, driven by the vision
[00:58.94] I've been livin', sittin' pretty, pretty fixin', pretty cities
[01:02.28] Busy, busy, uh, really gettin' busy with it, giddy up
[01:28.78] 
[01:05.84] (Yeah) uh, uh, woke up in that mode again
[01:09.12] (Yeah) uh, uh, please don't call my phone again
[01:12.45] (Yeah) uh, uh, walk in causin' havoc
[01:15.50] Yes, that is a habit
[01:17.48] Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah, yeah
[01:35.48] 
[01:19.47] Woke up feelin' like, like
[01:21.02] (Fuck up the world, fuck up the world)
[01:22.73] I think I just might, might
[01:24.22] (Fuck up the world, fuck up the world)

[01:30.33] I think-, I think-, I just-, I just-
[01:48.33] 
[01:32.27] Never seen no girl like this (this), stone-cold plus ice on wrist (on wrist)
[01:35.35] As bad as it gets, face card, crazy down to my fit
[01:38.32] I'm a chart-topping, exotic, a goddamn heart-throbbin' head dropper
[01:41.92] Just walked in and made jaws drop, see me wearin' it and watch it pop
[02:16.42] 
[01:45.28] Get it and double (double it), my bad went Byles, it's tumblin' (tumblin')
[01:47.99] High currency, I'm thumbin' it, oh, you thought I went hard? I'm uppin' it (uppin' it)
[01:51.20] I don't do generic, landed in Paris, lookin' real healthy, all on my carats
[01:54.73] Gave 'em a look now, got 'em all starin', gave me the crown, so might as well wear it, uh
[02:39.23] 
[01:58.36] (Yeah) uh, uh, woke up in that mode again
[02:01.46] (Yeah) uh, uh, please don't call my phone again
[02:04.89] (Yeah) uh, uh, walk in causin' havoc
[02:08.13] Yes, that is a habit
[02:09.88] Bad, I'm bad, I'm tragic, yeah, yeah
[02:27.88] 
[02:11.78] Woke up feelin' like, like
[02:13.37] (Fuck up the world, fuck up the world)

[02:21.76] I think I just might
[02:22.89] I think-, I think- I just-, I just-
[02:40.39] 
[02:24.78] Rappin' like my lease up, I told them that I'm focused (yeah, yeah)
[02:27.83] They want the old LISA? Then listen to my old shit (yeah, yeah)
[02:31.16] Rap it like a deep cut, flowin' like the ocean (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[02:34.20] They want the old LISA? Then listen to my old shit
[02:59.20] 
[02:38.07] Woke up feelin' like, like
